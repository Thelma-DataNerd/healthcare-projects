- Outcome: Some of the key insights from the analysis include:
  * Students with higher CGPA (3.50 - 4.00) experienced more panic attacks..
  * Female students had significantly higher rates of mental health conditions compared to males.
  * First-year students showed higher vulnerability to anxiety and depression, likely due to academic and social adjustments.
  * Only 6% of students sought medical treatment, indicating a potential gap in mental health awareness or access to resources.
